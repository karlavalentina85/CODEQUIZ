# CODEQUIZ
So in order to make this quiz, I started with the basic HTML and Bootstrap. A form, and some buttons. 
For the Java Script part, I created an array of objects to store questions, alternatives and the correct answer for each one of them. 
Functions to start the flow of the quiz.
I added a countdown timer, with the clear/set interval function. 
Every time an answer is wrong 25 seconds are subtracted from the time quiz.
The High Score is stored in local storage, and I used the 'JSON parse' to make the data into a JS object, in order to store new high scores and keep a record of them.
